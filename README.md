### How The Game Works
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, a point is lost and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water, a point is won and the player returns to the start square for another round of game play.

### Dependencies
